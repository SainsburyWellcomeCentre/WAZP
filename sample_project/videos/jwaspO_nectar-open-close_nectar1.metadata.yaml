Further_description: 'Jwasp O sourced from on-show display (all others sourced from
  upstairs BUGS holding room bestides jwaspM). Poster boards moved slightly during
  the control box closing with the servo motor. Timer was not fixed for this session
  and therefore stopped recording 31 minutes into this condition. I (Sanna) noticed
  this and restarted it 20 seconds later. I concatenated the two videos to create
  the full condition. I was watching the jwasp during this time and she did not visit
  any ROIs. We''re not really missing anything from that 20-second gap - however this
  explains the wasps movement 31 minutes in. '
