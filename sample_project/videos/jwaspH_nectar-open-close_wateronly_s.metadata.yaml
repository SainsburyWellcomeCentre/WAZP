Further_description: Jwasp H was transferred to the arena by manual restraint in Jaimie's
  hand (rather than using tube) - potential for effect on behaviour? Sanna checked
  the iButton thermohygrologger on 15:15 9/8/22. Data appeared to remain normal once
  the ibutton was moved out of the enclosure. Temperatures jumped half a degree of
  Celsius for one reading (26.547C) and then returned to inside enclosure temperatures
  (26.047C) while humidity stayed in its natural range of 50-67.5% (with regular fluctuations).
  For subsequent trials the iButton is set up outside the enclosure.
