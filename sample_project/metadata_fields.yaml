This column came into existence because at the beginning of this project, we had some issues acquiring a certain frame rate and playing back the video at another frame rate (due to mismatching the acquisition frame rate and the frame rate within Bonsai's VideoWriter node). Therefore, some videos are altered in speed (typically they are sped up).
