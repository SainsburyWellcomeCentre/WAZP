# WAZP 🐝
**W**asp **A**nimal-tracking **Z**oo project with **P**ose estimation
(name is subject to refinement)

## Overview

WAZP is a dashboard built with [Dash-Plotly](https://dash.plotly.com/) for analysing animal tracking data. It can display pose estimation output from [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut).

The package is currently in early development 🏗️ and is not yet ready for use. Stay tuned ⌛

## Installation

We recommend you install WAZP inside a [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment.
Once you have `conda` installed, the following will create and activate an environment. You can call your environment whatever you like, we've used `wazp-env`.

```sh
conda create -n wazp-env -c conda-forge python=3 pytables
conda activate wazp-env
```

Next install the latest version of WAZP from pip:

```sh
pip install wazp
```

## Launching the dashboard

Once installed, launch the dashboard by running the following command from the root of the repository:

```sh
startwazp
```
This will launch a local web server. If the dashboard does not automatically open in your default browser, click the link in the terminal to open it (the link will be of the form `http://localhost:8050/`).
